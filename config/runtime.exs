import Config

# config/runtime.exs is executed for all environments, including
# during releases. It is executed after compilation and before the
# system starts, so it is typically used to load production configuration
# and secrets from environment variables or elsewhere. Do not define
# any compile-time configuration in here, as it won't be applied.

# ## Using releases
#
# If you use `mix release`, you need to explicitly enable the server
# by passing the PHX_SERVER=true when you start it:
#
#     PHX_SERVER=true bin/trivia_advisor start
#
# Alternatively, you can use `mix phx.gen.release` to generate a `bin/server`
# script that automatically sets the env var above.

# Production Configuration
# =============================================================================
#
# In production, we connect to PlanetScale read replicas for the shared
# Eventasaurus database. Since Trivia Advisor is completely read-only,
# we use PgBouncer (port 6432) for efficient connection pooling.
#
# In development/test, we use the local eventasaurus_dev database
# (configured in dev.exs/test.exs) because:
# 1. PlanetScale has IP restrictions (only Fly.io IPs allowed)
# 2. Local development uses the same database Eventasaurus writes to
#
# See: https://planetscale.com/docs/postgres/scaling/replicas

  # Validate required PlanetScale environment variables

  ps_pass = System.fetch_env!("PLANETSCALE_DATABASE_PASSWORD")

  # ## SSL Support
  #
  # To get SSL working, you will need to add the `https` key
  # to your endpoint configuration:
  #
  #     config :trivia_advisor, TriviaAdvisorWeb.Endpoint,
  #       https: [
  #         ...,
  #         port: 443,
  #         cipher_suite: :strong,
  #         keyfile: System.get_env("SOME_APP_SSL_KEY_PATH"),
  #         certfile: System.get_env("SOME_APP_SSL_CERT_PATH")
  #       ]
  #
  # The `cipher_suite` is set to `:strong` to support only the
  # latest and more secure SSL ciphers. This means old browsers
  # and clients may not be supported. You can set it to
  # `:compatible` for wider support.
  #
  # `:keyfile` and `:certfile` expect an absolute path to the key
  # and cert in disk or a relative path inside priv, for example
  # "priv/ssl/server.key". For all supported SSL configuration
  # options, see https://hexdocs.pm/plug/Plug.SSL.html#configure/1
  #
  # We also recommend setting `force_ssl` in your config/prod.exs,
  # ensuring no data is ever sent via http, always redirecting to https:
  #
  #     config :trivia_advisor, TriviaAdvisorWeb.Endpoint,
  #       force_ssl: [hsts: true]
  #
  # Check `Plug.SSL` for all available options in `force_ssl`.

  # ## Configuring the mailer
  #
  # In production you need to configure the mailer to use a different adapter.
  # Here is an example configuration for Mailgun:
  #
  #     config :trivia_advisor, TriviaAdvisor.Mailer,
  #       adapter: Swoosh.Adapters.Mailgun,
  #       api_key: System.get_env("MAILGUN_API_KEY"),
  #       domain: System.get_env("MAILGUN_DOMAIN")
  #
  # Most non-SMTP adapters require an API client. Swoosh supports Req, Hackney,
  # and Finch out-of-the-box. This configuration is typically done at
  # compile-time in your config/prod.exs:
  #
  #     config :swoosh, :api_client, Swoosh.ApiClient.Req
  #
  # See https://hexdocs.pm/swoosh/Swoosh.html#module-installation for details.
